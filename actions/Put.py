#Placing
#Generally without overall (translational) motion,  an Agent
# places a Theme at a location, the Goal, which is profiled.
#  In this frame, the Theme is under the control of the Agen
#t/Cause at the time of its arrival at the Goal.  'David pla
#ced his briefcase on the floor.'  This frame differs from F
#illing in that it focuses on the Theme rather than the effe
#ct on the Goal entity.  It differs from Removing in focusin
#g on the Goal rather than the Source of motion for the Them
#e.
